# Oh, hi there!

This is a project I made to practice my React skills. Right now, you're looking at the code side of things.

If you meant to visit the actual site, you'll want to go here: [alexgmarty.github.io/dad-joke-emporium](https://alexgmarty.github.io/dad-joke-emporium)

This project is in active development, so it may look different in the future.
